# Patron Upload Project

## Process

1. Data Extraction
2. Data Processing
   - determine library-specific field values:
     - user profile
     - alternate id prefix
     - library code
3. Filter Data
   - exclude certain users from the upload (see process dox)
4. Write users to file according to LDUSER Flat Format
